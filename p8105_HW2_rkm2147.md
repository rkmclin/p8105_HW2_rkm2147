# Problem 1

Mr. Trash Wheel data

We will be importing the data, and then follow up by cleaning it.

``` r
trash_df = readxl::read_excel("./trash_wheel.xlsx",                    range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

We are next going to read and clean precipitation data for 2017/2018.

``` r
rain_2018 = readxl::read_excel("./trash_wheel.xlsx",                    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1) %>% 
        janitor::clean_names() %>% 
        drop_na(month) %>% 
        mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
        relocate(year)
  
rain_2017 = readxl::read_excel("./trash_wheel.xlsx",                    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1) %>% 
        janitor::clean_names() %>% 
        drop_na(month) %>% 
        mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
        relocate(year)
```

Next up, changing the variable of month into a complete month name and
then combining 2017 and 2018 into one table.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )

rain_df = bind_rows(rain_2017, rain_2018)

rain_df =
    left_join(rain_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
  select(year, total, month_name) %>% 
  relocate(month_name)
```

collected by Mr. Trash Wheel so far is 8724 and the total amount of
plastic bottles so far is 6.4436510^{5}. The median number of sports
balls in 2017 was 8. The size of the rain data frame is 24 rows by 3
columns. The total amount of precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

The transit dataset contains a total of 20548 variables. More
specifically the variables:line, station\_name, station\_latitude,
station\_longitude, entry, vending, entrance\_type, ada, route\_name,
route\_number. In my opinion this data is not very tidy\! Cleaning of
the data so far consisted of dropping tangential variables, cleaning up
variable names using the janitor tool, and changing entry into a logical
variable. I also used the pivot tool to condense the routes listed. The
size of the resulting data set is 20548 rows by 10 columns.

  - There are 465 distinct stations within the NYC transit.

  - There are a total of 84 distinct stations that are ADA compliant.

  - There are a total of 60 distinct stations that serve the A train.

  - The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending that
    allow entrance is 0.1043925.

  - There are a total of 17 distinct stations that serve the A train
    that are ADA compliant.

# Problem 3

Creating a Final 538 dataset from three sources of information\!

Importing and tidying of pols data

``` r
pols_df = read_csv("./538_data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year","month","day"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
polsmonth_df = 
    tibble(
        month = c("01","02","03","04","05","06","07","08","09","10","11","12"),
        month_name = month.name
    )

pols_df =
    left_join(pols_df, polsmonth_df, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(
    president = case_when(
      prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
      prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem",
      prez_gop == 2 ~ "gop",
      )) %>% 

select(year, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, rep_dem, sen_dem, month_name, president) %>% 
  relocate(year, month_name)
```

Importing and tidying of the snp data

``` r
snp_df = read_csv("./538_data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month","day","year"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
snpmonth_df = 
    tibble(
        month = c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12"),
        month_name = month.name
    )

snp_df =
    left_join(snp_df, snpmonth_df, by = "month") %>% 
  select(year, close, month_name) %>% 
  relocate(year, month_name)
```

Importing and tidying of the unemployment data

``` r
unemployment_df = read_csv("./538_data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "percentage"
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
unmonth_df =
  tibble(
    month = c("jan","feb","mar","apr","may","jun","jul","aug","sep","oct","nov","dec"),
    month_name = month.name
    )

unemployment_df =
    left_join(unemployment_df, unmonth_df, by = "month") %>% 
  select(year, month_name, percentage)
```

Need to merge the three resulting datasets into one using month and
year.

``` r
final538_df = left_join(pols_df, snp_df, by = c("year","month_name")) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))

final538_df = left_join(final538_df, unemployment_df, by = c("year","month_name"))
```

The Final 538 dataset combines three data frames containing information
regarding unemployment percentages, national politicians who are
democratic or republican, and the closing values of the S\&P stock
index. The resulting size of this frame is 822 rows x 11 columns.
Variables within this set include: year, month\_name, gov\_gop,
sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem, rep\_dem, sen\_dem, president, close,
percentage. Notable variables including “year”, “president”, “close”,
and “percentage”. The information spans between the years 1947, 2015.
Fun fact, in the year 2001 the average unemployment percentage was
4.7416667. Interestingly so, in the year of 1974, there were 2 gop
presidents. The most recent mean of the closing values for the S\&P
stock index was 2070.5649822.
