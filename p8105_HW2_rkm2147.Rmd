# Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

to omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) 

use reasonable variable names

omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data

round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

```{r}
trash_df = readxl::read_excel("./trash_wheel.xlsx",                    range = "A2:N408")
```
